                        When a product is purchased from a customer, Qrates carefully 
                        packages the product and ships it worldwide. We can also ship 
                        products to any designated location.

                    <h4>Selling on Qrates</h4>
                    <h5>
                        By storing your inventory in the Qrates warehouse, you 
                        can continue to sell your work on Qrates. You can 
                        manufacture the exact number of copies as your project 
                        collected at the end of the crowdfunding campaign, or 
                        you can make more copies and continue to sell them on 
                        Qrates.
                    </h5>
                    <h4>Repress</h4>
                    <h5>
                        Repressing records is always easy. Master stampers can 
                        be stored at the factory for 18 months at no charge, so 
                        there is no need to make new stampers within that time 
                        frame. Use the repress requests from fans as a signal on 
                        when to repress more records.
